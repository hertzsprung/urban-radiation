\section{Model}
TODO: explain approach, where our observations come from and over what period the data has been collected.

\subsection{Design}
The radiation model diagnoses shortwave and longwave radiation from three easily observed meteorological variables: air temperature near the surface, cloud cover, and relative humidity.  The shortwave radiation model is driven by the diurnal and seasonal variation of insolation throuh an atmosphere with a degree of cloud cover.  A simple longwave model is present that is based on air temperature alone, which is then refined based on Loridan's longwave parameterisation TODO cite loridan.
\subsubsection{Geometry}
Our model starts by estimating the insolation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA).  From, TODO: section 9.4 ambaum, the insolation at the top of the atmosphere, $\Kdowntoa$, is related to the total solar irradiance, $S_0$
\begin{align}
\Kdowntoa &= S_0 \left( \langle r_E \rangle / r_E(t) \right)^2 \cos \theta
\intertext{Neglecting orbital eccentricity this becomes}
\Kdowntoa &= S_0 \cos \theta
\intertext{$\theta$ is the solar zenith angle which is approximated by}
\cos \theta &= \sin \varphi \sin \delta + \cos \varphi \cos \delta \cos h
\end{align}
where $\varphi$ is the latitude, $h$ is the hour angle and $\delta$ is the declination of the Sun.  Given we are concerned with radiation in London, we can assume a longitude of \ang{0}, so the hour angle is approximately
\begin{align}
h = \left( t(\mathrm{seconds}) \cdot \ang{360} / 86400 \right) - \ang{180}
\end{align}
The declination of the Sun $\delta$ is approximated by
\begin{align}
\delta &= \ang{-23.44} \cdot \cos \left[ \frac{\ang{360}}{365} \cdot (N+10) \right]
\end{align}
where $N$ is the day of the year with $N=0$ being January 1.  This model results in insolation with annual and daily periods as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:toa-model}.

\subsubsection{Shortwave insolation}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\input{cloud-tau-fit}
\caption{Relationship between cloud cover and observed optical depth}
\label{fig:cloud-tau-fit}
\end{figure}

To model the insolation at the surface we estimate the optical depth of the atmosphere at a given time, $\tau(t)$.  This is calculated by comparing insolation at the surface, $\Kdownsfc$, and at the top of the atmosphere, $\Kdowntoa$ using the Beer-Lambert law
\begin{align}
&& \Kdownsfc &= \Kdowntoa\: \exp \left( -\frac{\tau}{\mu} \right) \\
\text{or equivalently} && \tau &= \mu \: \ln \left( \frac{\Kdownsfc}{\Kdowntoa} \right)
\end{align}
In Figure~\ref{fig:cloud-tau-fit} we find a weak relationship between observed cloud cover fraction $F_\mathrm{cloud}$ and optical depth $\tau$.  Using a simple linear regression we find
\begin{align}
\tau &= \gamma F_\mathrm{cloud} + \tau_\mathrm{clear}
\end{align}
where $\tau_\mathrm{clear}$ is the optical depth of clear sky ($F_\mathrm{cloud} = 0$) and $\gamma$ is the cloud optical depth coefficient.  At times when cloud coverage observations are unavailable surface insolation is modelled using the mean optical depth $\langle \tau \rangle$.  We find that $\langle \tau \rangle = 0.45$, $\tau_\mathrm{clear} = 0.14$,and $\gamma =  0.29$ with a residual sum of squares of 166.
%TODO: gnuplot told me this but my knowledge of stats isn't good enough to properly understand it.

\subsubsection{Longwave radiation}
The downwelling longwave radiation at the surface, $\Ldownsfc$, can be estimated by using a single-slab, isothermal atmosphere.  Using the observed air temperature immediately above the surface and assuming the atmosphere radiates as a blackbody we can use the Stefan--Boltzmann law
\begin{align}
\Ldownsfc = \varepsilon_\mathrm{ATM} \sigma T_\mathrm{ATM}^4 \label{eq:stefan-boltzmann}
\end{align}
where we assume that the atmospheric emissivity $\varepsilon_\mathrm{ATM} = 1$.  In our analysis in section~\ref{sec:model-analysis} we find that this simple approximation overestimates downwelling longwave radiation.

TODO Loridan et al propose a more refined longwave radiation model that is controlled by relative humidity $\mathrm{RH}$, cloud cover fraction $F_\mathrm{cloud}$ as well as air temperature.  Precipitable water content is a function of vapour pressure $e$ and temperature $T_\mathrm{ATM}$
\begin{align}
w &= 46.5 \frac{e(\si{\hecto\pascal})}{T_\mathrm{ATM}(\si{\kelvin})}
\intertext{From TODO ambaum, the vapour pressure is a function of relative humidity and saturated vapour pressure $e_s$}
e &= \mathrm{RH} \: e_s(T)
\intertext{where the saturated vapour pressure can be estimated by Tetens' formula}
e_s(\si{\hecto\pascal}) &= 6.112 \exp \left( \frac{17.67 T(\si{\celsius})}{T(\si{\celsius}) + 243.5} \right)
\intertext{The atmospheric emissivity is based on clear-sky emissivity and cloud cover fraction}
\varepsilon_\mathrm{ATM} &= \varepsilon_\mathrm{clear} + \left(1 - \varepsilon_\mathrm{clear} \right) F_\mathrm{cloud} \\
\varepsilon_\mathrm{clear} &= 1 - \left( 1 + w \right) \exp \left( - \sqrt{1.2 + 3w} \right)
\intertext{Substituting into Equation~\ref{eq:stefan-boltzmann}, the parameterisation of $\Ldownsfc$ becomes}
\Ldownsfc &= \left[ \varepsilon_\mathrm{clear} + \left( 1 - \varepsilon_\mathrm{clear} \right) F_\mathrm{cloud} \right] \sigma T_\mathrm{ATM}^4
\end{align}

\subsection{Analysis}
\label{sec:model-analysis}
The model is verified by comparing its output with radiation observed at KSS (TODO footnote for what KSS means).  Longwave radiation is better approximated but overestimates the observed value.  

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:shortwave-verification}, the model accurately diagnoses shortwave radiation with cloud cover observations alone with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of \SI{112}{\watt\per\meter\squared}.  When total cloud cover is observed for an extended duration of about one day, shortwave radiation is overestimated.  An example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:extended-cloud}.  In section~\ref{sec:further-work} we suggest a way of improving this.

Longwave radiation is systematically overestimated by the simple temperature-only model with a RMSE of \SI{59}{\watt\per\meter\squared}.  The Loridan longwave model is more accurate having a RMSE of \SI{47}{\watt\per\meter\squared}.  The two longwave models are compared with observed radiation in Figure~\ref{fig:longwave-verification} which shows systematic and unsystematic errors in TODO: both? models.

TODO: This could be due to the model wrongly assuming that air is a blackbody, and ignoring absorption and scattering effects.  Or the coefficients used in Loridan aren't quite right for us?  But I wouldn't know how to recalculate them...
