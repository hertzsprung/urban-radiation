TODO

A model is developed to predict downwelling longwave and shortwave radiation at the surface using observed cloud cover, air temperature and relative humidity.  Model results have a root-mean-squared error of \SI{112}{\watt\per\meter\squared} for shortwave and \SI{47}{\watt\per\meter\squared} for longwave.

\chapter{Model}
The radiation model was constructed around observation data collected from a Met mast from January 2010 to December 2012, and Vaisala CL31 cloud cover data from October to December 2010.  Both instruments were installed at KSS. TODO: footnote explaining where that is

\section{Design}
The model diagnoses shortwave and longwave radiation from three easily observed meteorological variables: air temperature near the surface, cloud cover, and relative humidity.  The shortwave radiation model is driven by the diurnal and seasonal variation of insolation through an atmosphere with an amount of cloud cover.  In section~\ref{sec:longwave-model} a simple longwave model is presented that is based on air temperature alone, which is then refined based on longwave parameterisation from \cite{loridan}.

\subsection{Geometry}
The model initially estimates the insolation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA).  The insolation at the top of the atmosphere, $\Kdowntoa$, is related to the total solar irradiance, $S_0$ \parencite{ambaum} section 9.4
\begin{align}
\Kdowntoa &= S_0 \left( \langle r_E \rangle / r_E(t) \right)^2 \cos \theta
\intertext{where $\langle r_E \rangle$ is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun and $r_E(t)$ is the distance at a given time.  This orbital eccentricity is neglected since it is small, so the equation simplifies to}
\Kdowntoa &= S_0 \cos \theta
\intertext{where $\theta$ is the solar zenith angle which is given by \cite[p. 317]{jacobson}}
\cos \theta &= \sin \varphi \sin \delta + \cos \varphi \cos \delta \cos h
\end{align}
where $\varphi$ is the latitude, $h$ is the hour angle and $\delta$ is the declination of the Sun.  Given we are concerned with radiation in London, we can assume a longitude of \ang{0}, so the hour angle is approximately \parencite[p. 319]{jacobson}
\begin{align}
h = \left( t(\mathrm{seconds}) \cdot \ang{360} / 86400 \right) - \ang{180}
\end{align}
The declination of the Sun $\delta$ is approximated by
\begin{align}
\delta &= \ang{-23.44} \cdot \cos \left[ \frac{\ang{360}}{365} \cdot (N+10) \right] % TODO: citation
\end{align}
where $N$ is the day of the year with $N=0$ being January 1.  This model results in insolation with annual and diurnal periods as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:toa-model}.

\label{fig:toa-model}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Shortwave insolation}
To model the insolation at the surface we estimate the optical depth of the atmosphere at a given time, $\tau(t)$.  This is calculated by comparing insolation at the surface, $\Kdownsfc$, and at the top of the atmosphere, $\Kdowntoa$ using the Beer-Lambert law \parencite{stephens}
\begin{align}
&& \Kdownsfc &= \Kdowntoa\: \exp \left( -\frac{\tau}{\mu} \right) \\
\text{or equivalently} && \tau &= \mu \: \ln \left( \frac{\Kdownsfc}{\Kdowntoa} \right)
\end{align}
The model treats optical depth as a linear function of cloud cover fraction $F_\mathrm{cloud}$ such that 
\begin{align}
\tau &= \gamma F_\mathrm{cloud} + \tau_\mathrm{clear} \label{eq:linear-sw-cloud}
\end{align}
where $\tau_\mathrm{clear}$ is the optical depth of clear sky ($F_\mathrm{cloud} = 0$) and $\gamma$ is the cloud optical depth coefficient.   Values for $\gamma$ and $\tau_\mathrm{clear}$ are found empirically in section~\ref{sec:parameterization}.

\subsection{Longwave radiation}
\label{sec:longwave-model}
The downwelling longwave radiation at the surface, $\Ldownsfc$, can be estimated by using a single-slab, isothermal atmosphere.  Using the observed air temperature immediately above the surface and assuming the atmosphere radiates as a blackbody we can use the Stefan--Boltzmann law \parencite[p. 168]{ambaum}
\begin{align}
\Ldownsfc = \varepsilon_\mathrm{ATM} \sigma T_\mathrm{ATM}^4 \label{eq:stefan-boltzmann}
\end{align}
if we assume that the atmospheric emissivity $\varepsilon_\mathrm{ATM} = 1$.  In our analysis in section~\ref{sec:model-analysis} we find that this simple approximation overestimates downwelling longwave radiation.

\cite{loridan} propose a more refined longwave radiation model that is controlled by relative humidity $\mathrm{RH}$, cloud cover fraction $F_\mathrm{cloud}$ as well as air temperature.  Precipitable water content is a function of vapour pressure $e$ and temperature $T_\mathrm{ATM}$
\begin{align}
w &= 46.5 \frac{e(\si{\hecto\pascal})}{T_\mathrm{ATM}(\si{\kelvin})}
\intertext{The vapour pressure is a function of relative humidity and saturated vapour pressure $e_s$ \parencite{ambaum}}
e &= \mathrm{RH} \: e_s(T)
\intertext{where the saturated vapour pressure can be estimated by Tetens' formula}
e_s(\si{\hecto\pascal}) &= 6.112 \exp \left( \frac{17.67 T(\si{\celsius})}{T(\si{\celsius}) + 243.5} \right)
\intertext{The atmospheric emissivity is based on clear-sky emissivity and cloud cover fraction}
\varepsilon_\mathrm{ATM} &= \varepsilon_\mathrm{clear} + \left(1 - \varepsilon_\mathrm{clear} \right) F_\mathrm{cloud} \\
\varepsilon_\mathrm{clear} &= 1 - \left( 1 + w \right) \exp \left( - \sqrt{1.2 + 3w} \right)
\intertext{Substituting into Equation~\ref{eq:stefan-boltzmann}, the parameterisation of $\Ldownsfc$ becomes}
\Ldownsfc &= \left[ \varepsilon_\mathrm{clear} + \left( 1 - \varepsilon_\mathrm{clear} \right) F_\mathrm{cloud} \right] \sigma T_\mathrm{ATM}^4
\end{align}

\subsection{Data cleansing}
The model must handle records with missing or nonphysical values that are present in the KSS dataset.  

Optical depth is not calculated in two cases.  First, for some records, the observed $\Kdownsfc$ is greater than the calculated $\Kdowntoa$.  This typically occurs at night when $\Kdowntoa$ is always zero but, due to instrument error, $\Kdownsfc$ is a small non-zero value.  Second, optical depth is effectively infinite when $\Kdownsfc = 0$ so it is not calculated.

At times when cloud coverage observations are unavailable this affects modelled shortwave and longwave radiation.  Surface insolation is modelled using the mean optical depth $\langle \tau \rangle$.  Cloud cover is assumed to be zero in the Loridan longwave model.

\section{Parameterization}
\label{sec:parameterization}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\input{cloud-tau-fit}
\caption{Relation between cloud cover and observed optical depth}
\label{fig:cloud-tau-fit}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:cloud-tau-fit} we find a weak relationship between observed cloud cover fraction $F_\mathrm{cloud}$ and optical depth $\tau$.  Using a simple linear regression we find coefficients for equation~\ref{eq:linear-sw-cloud} where $\tau_\mathrm{clear} = 0.14$ and $\gamma =  0.29$.  $\langle \tau \rangle = 0.45$,
% TODO with a residual sum of squares of 166.
%TODO: gnuplot told me this but my knowledge of stats isn't good enough to properly understand it.

\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:model-analysis}
The model is evaluated by comparing its output with radiation observed at KSS.  Longwave radiation is better approximated but overestimates the observed value.  

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:shortwave-verification}, the model accurately diagnoses shortwave radiation with cloud cover observations alone with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of \SI{112}{\watt\per\meter\squared}.  When total cloud cover is observed for an extended duration of about one day, shortwave radiation is overestimated.  An example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:extended-cloud}.  In section~\ref{sec:further-work} we suggest a way of improving this.

Longwave radiation is systematically overestimated by the simple temperature-only model with a RMSE of \SI{59}{\watt\per\meter\squared}.  The Loridan longwave model is more accurate having a RMSE of \SI{47}{\watt\per\meter\squared}.  The two longwave models are compared with observed radiation in Figure~\ref{fig:longwave-verification} which shows systematic errors in both models.

TODO: This could be due to the model wrongly assuming that air is a blackbody, and ignoring absorption and scattering effects.  Or the coefficients used in Loridan aren't quite right for us?  But I wouldn't know how to recalculate them...
