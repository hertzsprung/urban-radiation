Intro to what we're trying to do with our model; shortwave and longwave
What is the biggest impact on incoming radiation?
---> Geometry!
Let them choose a couple of latitudes, plot the annual TOA graph in realtime

Going to talk about shortwave, then longwave

What's the next biggest impact on incoming shortwave?
---> Clouds!
Show shortwave graphs

What's the biggest impact on downwelling longwave?
---> Air temperature
Show longwave graph of simple model

And also?
---> Water content and cloud cover (again!)
Show longwave graph of Loridan model
